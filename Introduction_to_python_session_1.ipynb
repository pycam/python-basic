    "- Python is a *dynamic, interpreted* general purpose programming language initially created by Guido van Rossum in 1991\n",
    "- It is a powerful language that supports several popular programming paradigms:\n",
    "    - procedural\n",
    "    - object-oriented\n",
    "    - functional\n",
    "- Python is widely used in bioinformatics and scientific computing, as well as many other fields and in industry\n",
    "- Python is considered to come with \"batteries included\" and the <a href=\"http://docs.python.org/2/library/\">standard library</a> (some of which we will see in this course) provides built-in support for lots of common tasks:\n",
    "    - interacting with files and the operating system\n",
    "    - working on networks and the internet\n",
    "    - numerical & mathematical functions \n",
    "    - graphical user interfaces\n",
    "    - ...\n",
    "- There is also a wide range of external libraries for areas not covered in the standard library, such as the BioPython project which provides tools for bioinformatics - we look at this briefly tomorrow\n",
    "- Python is available on all popular operating systems\n",

There are lots of these specifiers, but here are 3 useful ones:\n",
